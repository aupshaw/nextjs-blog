mission: 'Learn Next.js'

Probably the TL;DR is enough for this post. Basically when I finished the tutorial I wanted to keep going and I knew that I needed to come up with some different challenges where the answers weren't on the bottom of the page and the code was not pre-written. Along the way of the first steps of this journey into Next.js I started thinking more about how to help myself with learning goals. I enjoy aimlessly wandering through tech posts to keep tabs on the industry but taking time for deep dives takes more commitment. More than once I have put off doing deep dives and thought I'd get to that at some point. Knowing there's a few learning challenges that require deep dives and would be helpful for my growth, I needed to make a plan and stick to it. I knew having written goals for myself would help keep me on track so I came up with the idea to establish a mission with real goals. This Next.js customized blogsite became my first mission.

### TL;DR
I wanted to continue digging into Next.js and decided to customize the starter blog site and just come up with some simple posts about my journey.
