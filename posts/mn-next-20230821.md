title: 'Kickoff Learning Next.js'

mission: 'Learn Next.js'

If you read the about page, Next.js was tool I didn't have in my toolbelt that took me out of consideration for a project I would have enjoyed. That stung a bit. That day, I decided I was going to kickoff a mission to learn Next.js.  I jumped into [the learn section](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) of the docs with some assumption that there might be a todo app or a hello world app to follow along. What I found was better and I'll dig into why I say that on some of the next entries.

That is really all there is to the kickoff, just a recognition of a point in time where I decided to do something. As a footnote, the job requirement was quite reasonable; I was disappointed because the opportunity was exactly the kind of opportunity I was looking for and I was not ready. I enjoy working with React and having been out of the React world for about 18 months I was vaguely aware of Next.js but I certainly didn't understand the value add from Next.js.

### TL;DR
I didn't have required experience with Next.js to be considered for a project. I was determined to take a negative and turn it into a postive.
