The biggest thing I wanted to accomplish by changing out the structure from the "curated demo" was to gain better understanding of how the framework works. 
So far, smashing success - you really start to uncover what you don't know when you change navigation and how you want content to render. Im not done yet 
but I gained better understanding of layouts and pages vs components. Pulling in Mantine was a good exercise and I like what the controls provide out of the 
box. I did some cursory reading about ChakraUI and NextUI also. It seems all of those libraries bring value.

### TL;DR

The restructuring of navigation and adding content forced me to (begin to) solve problems I would not see by only following the curated path. It also 
strengthened my learnings from the curated path.
