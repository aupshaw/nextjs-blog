This was a busy week and most of what I accomplished on this site was putting plans to paper. I attended local React user group meeting and the topic of 
discussion was the [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev/) library. This seemed pretty useful so I want to incorporate that into this site for the 
experience points. I like the idea of out-of-the-box components that are easy to style and provide the functionality I want.
My immediate goal is to change the structure from the curated tutorial to match my own vision that I can build on.

EDIT: I also learned that remark doesn't do so well at formatting markdown checkboxes
