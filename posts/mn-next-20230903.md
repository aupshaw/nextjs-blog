In my previous post, I mentioned the [learn section](https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs) of the Next.js docs. I started here and I wanted to understand why we would consider Next.js over React. Afterall, isn't the differentiation between some other popular UI options and React that React is a Library vs a Framework? I guess I had a notion that using a react based framework was anti-beneficial to choosing React. But then I learned that [react.dev](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) recommends using a framework.

> If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community. Frameworks provide features that most apps and sites eventually need...


So for what next brings to the table, my takeaways are performance boosts as the top item to mention. It does this by pre-rendering and hence reducing the application size. Also, it standardizes some common structure which can increase maintainability as well as reduce some boilerplate code we would have to write. I think it is always a win to remove boilerplate code so that developers can focus on functionality. I think Next is bringing that as a big value add to React.

### TL;DR
Performance and structure were my takeaways as big value adds of Next.js and also React says that Next is legit.
