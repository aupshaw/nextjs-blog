I won't go too deep here and will just comment that I followed the steps in the tutorial pretty much verbatim. I did some experimenting along the way but primarily I wanted to start with the curated path. I felt the steps were easily consumable and focused. After finishing, I felt comfortable enough to be able to take on some non-curated challenges. I also liked the "choose your own adventure" approach where you could skip ahead. Since I already had some familiarity with React, I didn't work through those initial 2 primers of javascript and react. I read through the "From React to Next.js" section and dove in deep at the "Create your first app" section. Initially I had no intention to deploy out to Vercel platform but I ended up doing that and that was pretty impressed with the simplicity. It was nice to get to see some code deployed live and actually gave me the idea for my next steps. If you are reading this, you are seeing what I decided to do as my "non-curated" learning challenge. More on that in next post.

### TL;DR
The blog app tutorial was what I needed to begin my learning journey. I like the structure and felt like it was the right level of depth to experiment, gain understanding but also be able to move quickly through steps.
